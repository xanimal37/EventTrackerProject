## Description
This project is the backend of an app that tracks animals handled wildlife rehabilitation facility. Each animal references a species with associated conservation status (there are endangered and vulnerable species in the upper midwest!) Each animal also has an enclosure. The tracked events currently include:

- when the animal enters the facility
- when the animal leaves the facility (or terminates their rehab)
- when the animal is fed, including who did the feeding and any notes
- when the animal is medically treated (if they need it)
- when its enclosure has been cleaned
